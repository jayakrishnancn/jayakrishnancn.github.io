Our adventure began with an early morning flight to Chennai, where we had a quick breakfast at the airport lounge before boarding our flight to Port Blair. However, our flight from Chennai was delayed, and instead of reaching by noon, we arrived in Port Blair in the afternoon. Unfortunately, we missed our scheduled ferry, as the last one had already departed.

With a change in plans, we booked a hotel in Port Blair and decided to make the most of our unexpected stay by visiting Chidiya Tapu. This stunning beach, known for its breathtaking sunset views and tranquil environment, turned out to be a perfect way to unwind after a long journey. We ended our day with a delicious dinner at the hotel.

### **Day 2: Havelock Island & Scuba Diving**

We woke up early and boarded the first ferry to Havelock Island (Swaraj Dweep). The anticipation of experiencing one of the most beautiful islands kept us energized throughout the journey.

Upon arrival, we kicked off our adventure with scuba diving. It was an absolutely mesmerizing experience! The underwater world was vibrant with coral reefs and colorful marine life, making it a truly unforgettable moment for both of us.

After the dive, we spent a serene afternoon at Radhanagar Beach, soaking in the beauty of the soft white sands and clear blue waters. Holding hands and watching the sunset together made for a magical memory. Later in the evening, we returned to Port Blair and had a delightful dinner at our hotel.

### **Day 3: Ross Island & North Bay Island Adventures**
