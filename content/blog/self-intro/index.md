Hello Sapiens,

Welcome to my journal. Let me introduce myself. My Name is Jayakrishnan. I am from India. I like to live in a dynamic and thrilling environments, hence a full-stack developer. I like to focus more on new technologies in my interested area. Trying consistantly to improve myself for the last many years. I am currently working with an american company as a full-stack developer (JavaScript & Java).

Because I like TypeScript (a lot), you might see more javascript/typescript focused posts in my blog. I try to #tag all the posts and I will try to keep my contents up to date.

**Thank You**
